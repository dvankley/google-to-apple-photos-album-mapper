# Google to Apple Photos Mapper
A tool to help with migrating photos from Google Photos to Apple Photos.

I made this tool to make the migration process easier for myself and decided others might find it useful.

## Why You Might Want To Use This
I've used Google Photos for a while with the 'high quality' (read: limited quality) setting, but Google recently announced Photos "unlimited free 'high quality' storage" would be going away.
That combined with other reasons that are not relevant to this project led me to move to Apple Photos and iCloud.
However, I still have a lot of the original versions of my photos on my and my family members' devices and didn't want to permanently incur whatever 'high quality' downscaling Google applied to my uploaded photos.
We've also spent a lot of time organizing photos into Google Photos albums that we don't want to lose when migrating.

If this sounds like your situation, this project may help you.

## Why You Might Not Want To Use This
- If your photos aren't high resolution enough to get 'high quality' downscaled and you're happy straight importing them into Apple Photos then that might be good enough for your needs, although apparently it [can still be a pain](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/250486578).
- If you're not comfortable with running Mac automation scripts
